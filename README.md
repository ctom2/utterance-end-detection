# Utterance end detection

AlquistAI task.

Task: Recognize the end of an utterance based on already spoken words. 

The objective can be described as a binary classification task as the implemented models try to decide whether the input is a finished utterance (= the user already said everything he wanted) or if it was interrupted and it is necessary to keep listening to the user in order to analyse the desired task.
